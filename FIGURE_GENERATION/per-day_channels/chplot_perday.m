%% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Plot per-day continuous channel traces ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%{
    The following script imports .mat file containing a single channel's
    trace, prepares it, and plots it. Mat files are
    expected to be named "c{channel_number}" and contain a 1-by-N array of
    doubles, where N is the number of samples recorded. The variable
    'dir_trac' (line 41) must be changed to point to the containing
    directory.
    
    The script also assumes that recordings were done in the Open Ephys GUI
    as it uses the .oebin file to get the 'bit_volts' multiplier and
    multiplies the entire trace by that number to accurately represent the
    signal scale.

    Several channels can be plotted in a single figure by setting the
    "channs_of_interest" variable to the desired channel numbers (see line
    78). This will create a Mx1 figure where M is the number of channels
    plotted.
    
    You may also change the length of the plotted signal by setting the
    variable 'samples_toplot' (line 85).

    Data can be plotted directly if the appropriate data has already been
    produced (f.e. if the data was downloaded from
    www.github.com/rjibanezalcala/EXPLORE) bby running the block titled
    "Plot channels" (line 117), though 'filename_day_ch' must point to the
    correct directory (line 123).
