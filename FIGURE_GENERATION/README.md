The code and data herein generates some (not all) figures in our publication.

For the ephys data pre-processing and spike detection code which generated the data itself and the rest of the figures, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/lddavila/cluster_neuronspikes/tree/main/Porting%20Open%20Ephys ).

### Figures 6B and Supplemental 4A (inverted isolated spikes)
The figures were generated using code and data contained in the individual_spikes directory.

### Supplemental Figure 4D (per-day continuous trace comparison)
The figures were generated using code and data contained in the per-day_channels directory.

### Dependencies
Python code was written in Anaconda 23.7.2 running Python 3.9.12 64-bit | Qt 5.15.2 | PyQt5 5.15.7 on Spyder IDE 5.4.3
Matlab code was written in MatLab2023b with the Database Toolbox (23.2), open-ephys-matlab-tools (13.0.0), Parallel computing Toolbox (23.2), Signal Processing Toolbox (223.2), and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (23.2) add-ons installed. However it is unlikely these add-ons are needed for code execution.
All code was written in Windows 10 Pro.
